conda R 3.2.2!! needs a kick up the butt! see issues

#### Fix
- fresh install  anaconda and rm `~/.anaconda`  
- https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/1722  see tips here! dont update!  
- dont use conda r or r-essentials  
- use system R and install https://irkernel.github.io/   
- conflict coming when needing to use conda r-packages
