```{r cars}
if ("package:h2o" %in% search()) { detach("package:h2o", unload=TRUE) }

# Next, we download packages that H2O depends on.
pkgs <- c("methods","statmod","stats","graphics","RCurl","jsonlite","tools","utils")
for (pkg in pkgs) {
    if (! (pkg %in% rownames(installed.packages()))) { install.packages(pkg) }
}

# Now we download, install and initialize the H2O package for R.
install.packages("h2o", type="source", repos=(c("http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-turchin/8/R")))

library(h2o)

localH2O = h2o.init(nthreads=-1)

# Finally, let's run a demo to see H2O at work.
demo(h2o.kmeans)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
